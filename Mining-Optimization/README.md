# Meta-Heuristic Mining Optimization: Genetic Algorithms for NPV Maximization

This folder contains the MATLAB implementation and published research for optimizing extraction policies in Lead-Zinc deposits.

### **Core Research Impact**
By integrating a custom Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a 29-variable search space, this project solves the "Cut-off Grade" problem more effectively than traditional deterministic methods.
* **NPV Augmentation:** **+9.15% increase** compared to baseline Lane models.
* **Operational Longevity:** Extended mine life by **6 years** through optimized stockpiling.

### **Methodology & Workflow**

**Figure 1: Genetic Algorithm Optimization Workflow.** *This diagram outlines the meta-heuristic approach for long-term mine planning. It begins with geological and economic constraints (Stage 1), which are processed through a MATLAB-based Genetic Algorithm loop involving selection, crossover, and mutation operators (Stage 2). The final output (Stage 3) is a globally optimized schedule that delivers a 9.15% increase in Net Present Value (NPV) and extends the mine's life by 6 years.*

### **Strategic Results**

**Figure 2: Optimized 15-Year Extraction Schedule.** *This table illustrates the globally optimized production sequence generated by the Genetic Algorithm. By dynamically adjusting cut-off grades and integrating simultaneous stockpiling, the model achieved a stable production flow and maximized total NPV over the 15-year life of the mine.*
