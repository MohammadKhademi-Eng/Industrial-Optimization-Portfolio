## 🚀 Featured Project: Maintenance-Aware Digital Twin (MADO)
*Research submitted to the Journal of Computers and Industrial Engineering*

This project addresses the **vulnerability of static efficiency**—where traditional deterministic models fail under stochastic shop-floor disruptions. I developed a high-fidelity **Digital Twin** in AnyLogic to identify production policies that balance profit, energy efficiency, and operational resilience.

### **The Breakthrough: Scenario S1 vs. Scenario S5**
Using a multi-objective genetic solver, I identified a "hidden" regime (S5) where penalizing energy waste acts as a heuristic to stabilize production flow and mitigate the impact of random machine failures.

| Key Performance Indicator | Baseline (Profit-Only) | Optimized (Sustainability-Weighted) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean Profit (Robust)** | €2,720.88 | **€3,099.94** | **+13.9%** |
| **Throughput** | 39.5 units | **45.1 units** | **+14.1%** |
| **System Resilience** | High Instability | **Validated Stable Trajectory** | **Proven** |

- **Innovation:** "Deterministic Substitution"—trading random breakdowns for controlled, optimized Preventive Maintenance (PM) stops.
- **Stress Test:** The S5 policy proved robust under **±20% parameter drift** (aging equipment).
- **Tech Stack:** AnyLogic (DES), Java, OptQuest, Monte Carlo Verification (N=30).
- **Technical Evidence:** See the [Digital-Twin-Logistics Folder](./Digital-Twin-Logistics) for raw results and the [Technical Validation Report](./Digital-Twin-Logistics/Technical_Validation_Report.pdf). Also, This methodology and its stress-test data are the basis for the research paper: Khademi, M. (2026). "Resilience Under Parameter Drift: A Stress-Test Analysis of Industry 5.0 Digital Twins," submitted to the 23rd IFAC World Congress.
